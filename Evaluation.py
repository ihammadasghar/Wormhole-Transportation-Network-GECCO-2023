class wormhole_traversal_udp:
    """
    UDP (User-Defined Problem) class for the Wormhole Traversal Challenge of the
    SpOC competition as part of the GECCO 2023 conference.

    Conceptually, we define a sparse network of black holes (nodes) and wormholes (edges).
    Each edge in the network is associated with a mean and a variance, both of which are cumulative.
    The challenge is to minimise the maximum variance of any of the 12 paths traversed across
    the network while satisfying the equality and inequality constraints.

    The formal specification of the problem and all constraints and objectives
    can be found on its page on the Optimise platform:

    https://optimise.esa.int/challenge/spoc-2-wormhole-transportation-network/About

    For more information about the competition, please refer to the competition website:

    https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/gecco-2023-competition/

    This class conforms to the pygmo UDP format.
